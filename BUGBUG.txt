BUGS:
** - "properly commented"

 - MainWindow View reverts to All Songs and Albums when returning from a subwindow.

 - CDCatalogManager.GetPlaylists should return fully-populated objects. Does not currently return a list of Songs.

 - It would be nice if Add Song could select artist when user selects album and vice versa, without locking the user into those choices.

XX** - Add Album requires Album and Song to have the same Artist.
XX** - Adding an Artist only updates Album Artist combobox; does not update Song Artist combobox.
 - It would be nice if Add Album could select artist when user selects album and vice versa, without locking the user into those choices.

XX** - All Songs View should be All Songs and Albums.

XX** - Artist and Genre Views should be both Songs and Albums.

XX** - Title Search feature NYI.
