I built this CD catalog project as the capstone to my C# certification in 2015. 

Its intent is to track Songs and Albums in a user's music collection, and organize them by Artist and Genre. 

The user can also create Playlists of random songs, fit to a specified duration (+/- one minute).

In addition to the files and folders that are part of the Visual Studio solution, there are also some additional files:

- CDCatalogDropAndCreate.sql is the script used to generate an empty CD database on a SQL server. 
- CDCatalog.mdf and CDCatalog_log.ldf are the actual database files, populated with test data.
- BUGBUG.txt is a list of notes to myself about issues that needed to be fixed, and features that have not yet been implemented. Some issues are still active.
- Project Notes.txt is this file.
